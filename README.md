# Java OOP & Ant Build Examples

A sample repository showcasing core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java, alongside Ant build automation using XML-based scripts.

## üöÄ Overview

This project provides:

* **Java OOP Demonstrations**
  Practical examples of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and interfaces in Java.
* **Apache Ant Build Scripts**
  `build.xml` files illustrating how to compile, package, and clean Java applications via Ant.

This repository offers clear, hands-on examples of my Java expertise.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   Recommended: JDK 11 or higher.
   Download: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

2. **Apache Ant**
   Verify installation with:

   ```bash
   ant -version
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Build

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-oop-ant-examples.git
   cd java-oop-ant-examples
   ```

2. **Check Ant version**

   ```bash
   ant -version
   ```

   You should see output similar to `Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.12 compiled on ... etc`.

3. **Compile & Package**

   ```bash
   ant build
   ```

   * Runs the default `build` target defined in `build.xml`.
   * Compiled `.class` files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

4. **Clean Artifacts**

   ```bash
   ant clean
   ```

   * Removes compiled classes and archives from previous builds.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

After building, run the application as follows:

```bash
java mainCode
```

Replace `mainCode` with the appropriate filename.

## üßπ Clean Compiled Files and Docs
